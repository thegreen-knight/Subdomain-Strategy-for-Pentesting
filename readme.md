## My strategy for finding Subdomains

To use my strategy you first need to have gobuster installed you can find that here https://github.com/OJ/gobuster

Once you have that up I recommend using the subdomain.txt file I have in this repository to run the below command on your target domain.

```
gobuster dns -d {YOUR TARGET DOMAIN} -w subdomains.txt
```
This should give you a pretty good list of subdomains to look at from your target but my method takes it one step farther. Using the scan.py script in this repo you can find other subdomains to conduct your pentest against. The idea is that you are checking the SSL cert for other domain names. Sometimes when making a request to a none existant subdomain you will get a bunch of possible subdmains from a DNS server that you might never find otherwise.
```
python3 scan.py {YOUR TARGET DOMAIN}
```
You should run the base domain through the scan then run the subdomains found. Once you have ran every scan possible you should have a nice clean list of urls in the validDomains.txt. I plan on adding to this tool some more but right now it is usable as is.

Feel free to modify things as you see fit.
